<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am beginner web developer with huge amount of energy and stress resistance</p>

<p>I decided to start my way in IT not so long ago, but i am taking this seriously, because I feel real passion on it. </p>

<p>I fifnished Bogomolets National Medical University, which is the best medical university of Ukraine,and did it perfectly
. But after this I realised that medicine dont suits me and decided to switch to something that interests me more. And it is Web Development! I am sure, i will become real proffesional in it. </p>
